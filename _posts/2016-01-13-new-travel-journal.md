# New Travel Journal

I'm sitting in the Menzies Business Lounge at Arlanda airport in Stockholm. I've been here for about 5 hours already, and my plane has just been delayed. 

I was supposed to be travelling to Vienna with Michela today for a European project meeting - but instead my first trip of 2016 is a last-minute booking to Berlin for a meeting with the owner of [Funkhaus][0]. It looks like that will be our venue for Music Tech Fest Berlin. Quite excited about that - pictures to follow.

In the meantime, while I wait for my flight, I'm starting this new blog as a personal travel journal. Nice to have a separate place to keep this stuff.
